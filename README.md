# Todoer

A vscode extension to help with handling simple markdown checklists. Hopefully compatible with Dendron.

<!-- Badges once we get something -->

## Hopeful Features

Going to turn these into github issues at some point soon.

- All features should keep in the mind flexibility with settings(i.e. ) and compatibility with Dendron
- Ability to create a todo with a shortcut, will toggle if pressed again
- Ability to mark a todo as complete with a shortcut, will toggle if pressed again
- Ability to add a start time to a todo with a shortcut
- Ability to add a end time with a duration when the todo is completed and it has a start time
- Ability to pause a todo, which should keep when it was started, add a pause notation, and a duration of time so far
- Ability to archive completed tasks in the same file
- Ability to archive completed tasks to another file

Dendron tags can be used for importance/priority.
